            <li>
              <h3>Make your phone a light phone</h3>
              <p>Make your phone <a href="https://grant-collins.medium.com/turn-your-iphone-into-the-light-phone-23964a325f70" aria-label="Read more about light phones">less distracting and engaging</a>. Use only essential apps on your phone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Reduce Exposure</h3>
              <p>Delete social media apps and only re-download them when you set a timer or say aloud that you will only spend 30 minutes on it. Block YouTube on your browser and only allow the website when you can say aloud the YouTuber’s name whose new video you want to watch. Also, set limits on time spent on social media.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Restrict electronics for older teens and young adults</h3>
              <p>Parents should not give young children devices because they are kickstarting their addiction. Allow them to play as kids did without devices. Giving kids devices isn’t an easy fix to a problem, it opens a pathway to a lifelong addiction to the social media system. In their teens, if they choose to get social media, advise them of the risks, but don’t restrict them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Be in Check with your Emotions</h3>
              <p>Be aware of how you’re using it and how it makes you feel. Follow accounts that make you feel good. Remind yourself that you’re seeing a highlight reel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Unfollow, Deactivate, or Delete</h3>
              <p>Unfollow those random people you don’t talk to! Just because they’re your best friend’s friend’s sibling, doesn’t mean you have to follow them. If social media is making you feel extremely depressed, it's time to disconnect and take a break. You can either deactivate your account for a little while (News flash: you dont miss anything), or delete your account if it feels right to you. Don't feel pressured to act only when it's too late, act before your mental health gets worse.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>You Time > Social Media</h3>
              <p>Know that you don’t have to post every interaction with a friend or family member, every outgoing, or anything on social media. Keep things private. The best memories come from being in the moment. So take a step back and enjoy the moment right in front of you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Social Media Safety Course</h3>
              <p>For School districts - teach a social media safety course for pre-teens and teenagers. These topics should cover cyberbullying, privacy, mindfulness, oversharing, and so on.</p>

              <h3>Have accounts be verified by ID</h3>
              <p>Easier to track those who spread hateful comment, identify and ban certain individuals, prevent children from downloading social media apps, and hold people accountable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Update Use and Abuse Policies</h3>
              <p>Those who spread hateful and graphic content will be banned from the social media site and face fines in real life. Those who spend too much time on the app should get a message that stats "You been on this app for awhile, do you want to take a break?"</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Higher Age Rating</h3>
              <p>No kids should be on these platforms and no parents should profit from their kids. Social media should have an age restriction of 16-18+.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Remove Infinite Scroll</h3>
              <p>Remove the endless scroll or “load more” button - most websites have an end.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Awareness Advertisements</h3>
              <p>Stop promoting in ads to use electronics for everything. Promote real-life interactions, make the advertisements more meaningful (immigrant families connecting over an app, etc.) - electronics should be for breaks and entertainment, they shouldn’t make up our whole day. It should be an accessory to the commercial, not the entire concept. Also make campaigns spreading awareness of the effects of social media (just like for drugs - it is a drug).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Photoshop Warnings</h3>
              <p>Put warnings on all photoshopped/facetuned pictures (ie. this picture was photoshopped and does not depict real life).</p>
