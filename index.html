      <p class="abt-description">Social media has grown in popularity throughout the decade and has become a significant part of people’s lives. It is both an escape from reality and a way to connect with others in your life and around the world.</p>
      <img src="images/social-media-icons.png" alt="Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook icons" role="presentation">
      <p>With Instagram, Facebook, and Tiktok growing in popularity, they have brought upon positive experiences and questionable effects on its users. Moreso, users and scientists are questioning the impact social media has on adolescents’ mental, physical, and emotional well-being.</p>

      <h3>Adolescence</h3>
      <img src="images/teens-looking-at-phones.jpg" alt="three teens lying on their stomachs looking at their phones">
      <p>During adolescence, there is an increase in social validation and peer evaluation. Social media introduces a new method and experience in indulging in these needs: constant online availability, oversharing personal information (permanently online), and peer feedback through likes, views, and comments.</p>
      <p>While it seems harmless, it is quite the opposite. Social media has <emphasis>increased</emphasis> the feeling of anxiety, depression, and suicide among adolescents since the introduction of social media on mobile devices.</p>

      <p>But, as smartphone use increased, so did feelings of depression. In a 2017 study with 8th to 12th graders, they found high levels of despressive symptoms increased by</p>

      <p class="under-percent">Child suicide rates increased by up to</p>
      <h2 class="percents">150%</h2>
      <p class="under-percent">and self-harm by girls ages 10 to 14 <emphasis>nearly tripled</emphasis>. These patterns point to social media.</p>

      <p>Sadly, it is an easy access for youth to experience negative behaviours and ideation. These behaviours include cyberbullying, social exclusion/online conflict, coming across risky content, experiencing comparison, oversharing, and wasting hours on social media.</p>
      <h3 class="good-quote">Is social media an escape from real life or is real life an escape from social media?</h3>
