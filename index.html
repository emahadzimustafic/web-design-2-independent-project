      <div class="adolescnece-p">
        <p>During adolescence, there is an increase in social validation and peer evaluation. Social media introduces a new method and experience in indulging in these needs: constant online availability, oversharing personal information (permanently online), and peer feedback through likes, views, and comments.</p>
        <p>While it seems harmless, it is quite the opposite. Social media has <emphasis>increased</emphasis> the feeling of anxiety, depression, and suicide among adolescents since the introduction of social media on mobile devices.</p>

      <p>As smartphone use increased, so did feelings of depression. In a 2017 study with 8th to 12th graders, they found high levels of despressive symptoms increased by</p>

        <p>Sadly, it is an easy access for youth to experience negative behaviours and ideation. These behaviours include cyberbullying, social exclusion/online conflict, coming across risky content, experiencing comparison, oversharing, and wasting hours on social media.</p>
