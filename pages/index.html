      <p>Social media has grown in popularity throughout the decade and has become a significant part of people’s lives. It is both an escape from reality and a way to connect with others in your life and around the world. With Instagram, Facebook, and Tiktok growing in popularity, they have brought upon positive experiences and questionable effects on its users. Moreso, users and scientists are questioning the impact social media has on adolescents’ mental, physical, and emotional well-being.</p>

      <h3>Adolescence</h3>
      <p>During adolescence, there is an increase in social validation and peer evaluation. Social media introduces a new method and experience in indulging in these needs: constant online availability, oversharing personal information (permanently online), and peer feedback through likes, views, and comments.</p>
      <p>While it seems harmless, it is quite the opposite. Social media has increased the feeling of anxiety, depression, and suicide among adolescents since the introduction of social media on mobile devices.</p>

      <h3>The Stats</h3>
      <p>Between 2012 and 2015, depression in boys increased by 21% and in girls by 50%.
      By 2015, 92% of teens and young adults owned a smartphone. But, as smartphone use increased, so did feelings of depression.
      A 2017 study of 8th to 12th graders found that high levels of depressive symptoms increased by 33% between 2010 and 2015. The suicide rate for girls in this age group increased by 65%.
      And it’s only gotten worse.
      Child suicide rates increased by up to 150%, and self-harm by girls ages 10 to 14 nearly tripled. These patterns point to social media.</p>
      <p>Sadly, it is an easy access for youth to experience negative behaviours and ideation. These behaviours include cyberbullying, social exclusion/online conflict, coming across risky content, experiencing comparison, oversharing, and wasting hours on social media. Is social media an escape from real life or is real life an escape from social media?</p>
