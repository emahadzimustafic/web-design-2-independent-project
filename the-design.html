        <h3><b>Ephemeral Content</b></h3>
        <p>content that is only available for a limited time and then vanishes. It feeds into the FOMO (fear of missing out) culture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Infinite Scroll</b></h3>
        <p>Feeding into endless content can put you in a trance, innovation kept users looking at their phones for longer than necessary. It's essentially an in-pocket slot machine.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Advertisements</b></h3>
        <p>Personalized for the user. Creepy enough, your devices listen to you while you speak, detect keywords and personalize your ads according to them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Personalized Algorithm</b></h3>
        <p>Uses your data to keep you wrapped up in the content you consume. Personalized feeds have progressed to recognizing the things you prefer to see before interacting with them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Notifications</b></h3>
        <p>Built a routine of checking our phone and apps when there's nothing to see. Falsely hearing our phone vibrate when nothing actually happened.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Clickbait Thumbnails</b></h3>
        <p>TikTok itself promotes extreme and oversexualized thumbnails - an app that’s mainly used by teens. 32.5% of TikTok users are aged between 10 and 19. The age restriction is 12+, but there are 10 year olds using this app?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Like Button</b></h3>
        <p>Posting an image or tweet that gains a lot of likes ultimately translate into three of the most powerful reinforcers — attention, approval, and affection from other people. You end up posting more, each time trying to out-perform your previous posts like count.</p>

        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Anonymity</b></h3>
        <p>It can be a good thing for some, but the majority of the time, anonymous people are provoking arguments, spreading hate, violence, etc online. This prevents social media companies from being able to hold these individuals accountable.</p>

        <h3><b>Harmful Trends/Content</b></h3>
        <p>Being exposed to harmful or oversexualized/graphic content can rewire the developing brain
        Oversexualized dances performed by minors (ex. WAP dance, hip-thrusting, twerking, sexual dance challenges). In fact, there are many users that normalize grooming and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GinRfKa3sVs">romaticize the idea of dating older men.</a></p>

        <h3><b>Comparison</b></h3>
        <p>Trends that only benefit those that have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAoIRBLzoc">eurocentric features</a> and that have won the biological lottery: hourglass waist trend, symmetrical face trend, nice nose profile trend, baggy clothes vs bikini trend, “glow up” trend (for those who are attractive and align with eurocentric beauty standards).</p>

      <li>
        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Misogynistic Trends</b></h3>
        <p>Trends about waist size, nose profile, face symmetry, light eyes, light skin, thick hair, etc. are more popular than promoting body neutrality. Many users participating in these trends end up more anxious and depressed about their looks.</p>

        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Skipping Pre-Teen Years</b></h3>
        <p>Because of the <i>cringe</i> culture, children are growing up faster than they should. They don’t go through their awkward phase, they don’t transition from childhood to preteen years, they’re catapulted into their teen years, having to present themselves older than they are.</p>

        <h3><b>Living Through our Phones</b></h3>
        <p>Instead of talking to friends friends or family, social media seems more entertaining. We watch other people live their lives through social media, and when we get to do the same, we go on our phones. Real-life doesn’t provide us with the same serotonin boost as social media does.</p>

        <img src="#" alt="insert img or illustration here">
        <h3><b>Popularity > Privacy</b></h3>
        <p>What you post on the internet stays forever. Many TikTok users casually share too much information and explicit content to their followers. It ranges from specifics in their intimate life, people they despise, to hateful content — all for views and validation.</p>
