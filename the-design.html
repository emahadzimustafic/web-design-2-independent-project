      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Ephemeral Content</h3>
          <p>Content that is only available for a limited time and then vanishes. It feeds into the FOMO (fear of missing out) culture. We constantly refresh our feeds to distract ourselves from the real world and our responsibilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Infinite Scroll</h3>
          <p>Feeding into endless content can put you in a trance, innovation kept users looking at their phones for longer than necessary. It's essentially an in-pocket slot machine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Advertisements</h3>
          <p>Personalized for the user. Creepy enough, your devices listen to you while you speak, detect keywords and personalize your ads according to them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Personalized Algorithm</h3>
          <p>Uses your data to keep you wrapped up in the content you consume. Personalized feeds have progressed to recognizing the things you prefer to see before interacting with them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Notifications</h3>
          <p>Built a habit of checking our phone and apps when there's nothing to see. Falsely hearing our phone vibrate when nothing actually happened.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Clickbait Thumbnails</h3>
          <p>TikTok itself promotes extreme and oversexualized thumbnails - an app that’s mainly used by teens. 32.5% of TikTok users are aged between 10 and 19. Constant exposure to inappropriate content rewires the brain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Like Button</h3>
          <p>Posting an image or tweet that gains a lot of likes ultimately translate into three of the most powerful reinforcers — attention, approval, and affection from other people. You end up posting more, each time trying to out-perform your previous posts like count.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Anonymity</h3>
          <p>It can be a good for some, but the majority of the time, anonymous people are provoking arguments, spreading hate, violence, etc online. This prevents social media companies from holding these individuals accountable.</p>

              <h3>Harmful Trends/Content</h3>
              <p>Being exposed to harmful or oversexualized/graphic content can rewire the developing brain. Oversexualized dances are performed by minors (ex. WAP dance, hip-thrusting, twerking, etc.) to participate in a trend that's completely unrelated to the sexual move, further normalizing these moves across TikTok. On the other hand, there are many older users that normalize grooming and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GinRfKa3sVs" aria-label="Read more about the normalization of grooming">romaticize the idea of dating older men.</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Comparison/Beauty Standards</h3>
              <p>Trends that only benefit those that have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nAoIRBLzoc" aria-label="Read more about TikTok's unreachable beauty standards">eurocentric features</a> (small nose, small waist, tall, straight and thick hair, etc.) and that have won the biological lottery. There are trends that further promote these harmful standards such as the hourglass waist trend, symmetrical face trend, nice nose profile trend, baggy clothes vs bikini trend, “glow up” trend, etc. Many users participating in these trends end up more anxious and depressed about their looks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Content Overconsumption</h3>
              <p>Humans are not designed to consume the amount of info we do on social media.The algorithm makes us extremely anxious and numb; while one post can be about BLM, another can be a friend on a picnic, and so on. We become overwhelmed with the amount of negative news and shut down. No one can truly comprehend the number of followers and interactions with their accounts, no one can tell the difference between the truth and fake news.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Skipping Pre-Teen Years</h3>
              <p>Because of the cringe culture, children are growing up faster than they should. They don’t go through their awkward phase and they don’t transition from childhood to preteen years. These children are catapulted into their teen years, having to present themselves older than they are. There are some instances of children content creatures presenting themselves as teens or young adults (ex. Dani Cohn, Piper Rockelle, etc.). This can also be a direct result of their parents exploiting them for money.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Living Through our Phones</h3>
              <p>Instead of talking to friends or family, social media seems more entertaining. We watch other people live their lives through social media, and when we get the opportunity, we go on our phones. Images aren't memories anymore, they're posts for social media. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211368117301687" aria-label="Read more about photo-taking and memory loss">Scientific evidence</a> states that we have memory reduction from recording and taking photos instead of taking in what's in front of us. Real-life doesn’t provide us with the same serotonin boost as social media does. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Popularity > Privacy</h3>
              <p>What you post on the internet stays forever. Many TikTok users casually share too much information and explicit content to their followers. It ranges from specifics in their intimate life, people they despise, (non-educational) personal tramautic experiences to hateful content — all for views and validation. Not only does it desensitize its users, it teaches users to disclose their most personal information for a few seconds of fame.</p>

          <p>Looking at it as a whole, you may think it's obvious that this is a problem, but it isn’t. These app were designed to make you addicted, implement features to seem like they care about their users, but just enough so that their in control of your addiction.</p>
